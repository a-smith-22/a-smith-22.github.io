									<p>Below is a list of the major projects completed across my undergraduate academic studies, listed in chronological order from most recent to oldest. These projects cover a wide range of course material and concentrations, including engineering design projects, data science analyses, software development, novel research, design competitions, and more. A diverse set of skillsets were therefore developed in creating these projects, which led to them being featured as shown below.</p>
